    "#### The Martingale System\n",
    "The Martingale system is the most popular and commonly used strategy in online Roulette. The concept behind the strategy is quite simple – you increase your bets after every loss, so when you eventually win, you get your lost money back. After this, you start betting with the initial amount again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective way to use the Martingale system is to only bet on even-money outside bets – [1-18 versus 19-36], [Red versus Black], and [Even versus Odd]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outside bets in Roulette have almost 50% chance of winning, but they offer the lowest payout of all – 1:1. This means that you win the same amount of money you bet for the spin.\n",
    "The Martingale system seems quite logical and fairly simple to implement. However, many seasoned players don’t like it very much. The Martingale is rather risky, and you’re essentially betting big to win small. And there is a risk of losing a huge amount of money while using this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D’Alembert system\n",
    "Like the Martingale system, the D’Alembert system is based on bets placed on even-money areas of the table. However, instead of doubling the stake after a losing bet, as in the Martingale, one unit is added to the player’s stake. After a win, the stake decreases by one unit.\n",
    "Let’s assume you place a base unit stake of £1. If the bet loses, the next wager is £2. If that loses, the next bet becomes £3, and so on. If you manage to win the £3 bet, your following bet will drop to £2.\n",
    "One of the biggest advantages of this system is that it keeps a handle on your streaks, at least in the short term. You’re not doubling your wager after each loss, as in the Martingale, and things do even out if you win as many spins as you lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Fibonacci system\n",
    "The Fibonacci system is one of the safest Roulette strategies, especially when you compare it with other progressive methods like the Martingale. Despite the fact that it’s quite safe to use, the Fibonacci still has the potential to bring you some wins.\n",
    "This strategy is based on the popular Fibonacci numbers – a sequence where the next number you get equals the sum of the previous two. The sequence looks like:\n",
    "1 – 1 – 2 – 3 – 5 – 8 – 13 – 21 – 34 – 55 – 89 – 144 – 233 – 377 – 610 – 987\n",
    "In the game of Roulette, the Fibonacci system involves betting by adding the last two bets together. By doing so, you can leave with a profit even if you lose more games than you win.\n",
